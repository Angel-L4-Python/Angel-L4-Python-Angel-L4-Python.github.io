            <div class="description"> <h2> Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat</h2>
                <p>Inazuma <i>(Japanese: 稲妻 Inazuma)</i> is one of the seven regions of Teyvat. 
                  It is an archipelagic region that worships <strong>Shogun, <em>the Electro Archon and God of Eternity</em></strong> — who is also the leader of its governing body, the Inazuma Shogunate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While she continues to rule over her people in Inazuma, she doesn't directly communicate with them, instead being relayed the events of the world through the various Commissions who run day-to-day operations in the region. 
                One year prior to the events, thanks to the influence of the Tenryou and Kanjou Commission, the Shogun implements both the Sakoku Decree, shutting Inazuma off to the rest of Teyvat, and the Vision Hunt Decree, banning the use of Visions within Inazuma and calling for the confiscation of Visions from all residents. 
                Since this moment, no new Electro Visions have appeared in the world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In opposition to this, a young man sought to stand against the decree and fought in a Dual Before the Throne, but lost to Kujou Sara, a member of the Kujou clan of the Tenryou Commission and one of those overseeing the Vision Hunt Decree. 
                Following this, the Sanganomiya Resistance is formed to fight back against the Decree, overseen by Sanganomiya Kokomi on Watatsumi Island. 
                They have been at civil war with the Shogunate Army ever since, currently resulting in a stalemate between the two sides.
